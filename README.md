# TensorFlow-TitanicDataset
A Jupyter Notebook that uses a Scikit-Learn RandomForestClassifier model on a dataset that contains information about patients and whether they have had a stroke. The dataset includes information about the patients' gender, age, bmi, and smoking_status among other attributes. Given a csv file with this data, the goal is to explore and clean the data before establishing feature columns and splitting the data into a training and testing set so we can train our model and predict which patients had a stroke in the test data set. 

## Project Status
I plan to add multiple other training models in order check what algorithm performs the best on the dataset for a binary classification problem. After additional exploration of the data, there could potentially be crossed features that are worth adding to the model, in order to improve its performance. 

## Requirements 
- Python3 
- scikit-learn 
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib (for visualization)
- seaborn (for visualization)
